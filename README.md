# [Ammachi-as-a-Service] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [drag-on]


### Team Members
- üë®‚Äçüíª**Team Lead: ** Srinanth MV ‚Äì *Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Science and Technology*

### Project Description
> A brutally honest virtual grandma (Ammachi) who watches you, reads your expressions, and gives you mood-based scoldings, advice, or affection ‚Äî whether you want it or not.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
These days, everyone has productivity tools, focus apps, and AI assistants to help them work better. But no one has a digital version of an Ammachi (Grandma) to scold and nag you into feeling guilty ‚Äî like the good old days. The emotional damage of Ammachi‚Äôs sarcasm is missing in today‚Äôs tech.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This website brings that back. Without offering any real productivity, it gently (or not-so-gently) annoys you with Ammachi‚Äôs random nagging mails while you browse. Ammachi-as-a-Service (AaaS) is a 100% useless, yet emotionally powerful productivity blocker. You‚Äôll get no work done, but you‚Äôll hear Ammachi‚Äôs voice in your head.
